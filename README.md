# React Notifications Demo

A tiny Vite + React demo showing basic notification types (success, error, info, warning, custom).
Includes:
- NotificationsProvider + hook
- NotificationsContainer component
- Auto-dismiss and manual close

Run locally:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open the address printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

This project is intentionally dependency-light so it's easy to study and extend.
